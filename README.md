# Fusion-3-3-Industrial-AI
Project F3,3 Redefining Industrial Reliability via Multi-Modal Fusion. This framework bridges the "Trust Gap" by fusing structured telemetry, environmental context, and unstructured logs. Built on a distributed PySpark architecture with Temporal Fusion Transformers, it targets a 70% reduction in downtime to protect enterprise EBIT margins.
