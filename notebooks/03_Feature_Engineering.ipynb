        "## (1) Executive Objective\n",
        "The goal of this notebook is to transform our regime-normalised sensor data into a high-dimensional feature set capable of capturing engine degradation dynamics over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will transition from **point-in-time** observations to **sequence-based** inputs, which are essential for Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), LSTMs, or Transformers.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Feature Engineering Strategy\n",
        "\n",
        "To build a robust prognostic model, we must move beyond the \"snapshot\" of a single engine cycle. A single sensor reading might tell us the engine is hot, but it doesn't tell us if it is *getting hotter* over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Piecewise Linear RUL (Target Engineering)\n",
        "\n",
        "In real-world aerospace applications, an engine does not begin degrading the moment it leaves the hangar. There is a \"stable\" period followed by a \"wear-out\" period.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **The Logic:** We cap the RUL at a fixed value (e.g., 125 cycles). If the true RUL is 200, we label it as 125. Once the true RUL drops below 125, we follow the linear decline.\n",
        "* **The Benefit:** This prevents the model from trying to learn \"noise\" during the healthy phase and focuses the gradient descent on the actual degradation slope.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Temporal Windowing (The \"Memory\" Effect)\n",
        "\n",
        "Deep learning models for PHM (Prognostics and Health Management) perform best when fed a 2D \"image\" of recent history.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Method:** We stack the last $N$ cycles (e.g., $N=30$) into a single input window.\n",
        "* **The Benefit:** This allows the model to detect temporal patterns, such as oscillations or gradual drifts, that are invisible in a single row of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Rolling Statistics (Trend Extraction)\n",
        "\n",
        "While Deep Learning can learn patterns, we can assist the model by explicitly calculating the \"Physics of Change\" through moving averages and standard deviations over the sliding window.\n",
        "\n",
        "* $\\mu_{rolling}$: Captures the current trend (Velocity).\n",
        "* $\\sigma_{rolling}$: Captures increasing instability (Acceleration/Jitter).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Lagged Differencing ($\\Delta$Health)\n",
        "\n",
        "We will compute the delta between the current cycle and $T-n$ cycles ago.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **The Benefit:** This provides a direct numerical representation of the degradation rate, making it easier for the model to differentiate between a \"Stable High\" reading and a \"Rapidly Rising\" reading."

Since the sensor signatures at these points are often identical, this creates \"gradient noise\" that hinders model convergence and penalises the model for being unable to predict the unpredictable early-life state.\n",

        "## (4) Feature Engineering: Rolling Statistics & Delta Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "While Deep Learning architectures can inherently learn temporal patterns, providing explicitly engineered **Trend Features** significantly reduces training time and improves model robustness by reducing the search space for the optimisation algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4.1 Feature Definitions\n",
        "* **Rolling Mean ($\\mu_{rolling}$):** Acts as a low-pass filter to remove high-frequency sensor jitter. In PHM, this represents the **Velocity** of component degradation.\n",
        "* **Rolling Standard Deviation ($\\sigma_{rolling}$):** Captures increasing signal instability. As an engine approaches EOL (End of Life), mechanical clearances and thermal efficiencies often fluctuate, leading to increased \"jitter\". This serves as a primary feature for risk-aware modelling.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4.2 Mathematical Justification for Window Size ($W$)\n",
        "To move beyond heuristic-based window selection, we utilised **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)**, **Auto-Correlation (ACF)**, and **Partial Auto-Correlation (PACF)** functions to determine the optimal \"memory depth\" of the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Stationarity (ADF Test):** Application of the ADF test to the regime-normalised signals yielded $p$-values $> 0.05$. This mathematically confirms **non-stationarity**, proving the signals contain a persistent degradation trend rather than a random walk, thus necessitating temporal models.\n",
        "* **ACF (Persistence):** The slow, linear decay in the ACF confirms long-term persistence in the signal, suggesting that the sensor state is heavily influenced by its historical trajectory.\n",
        "* **PACF (Optimal Lag):** The Partial Auto-Correlation analysis for `s_11_norm` shows significant direct correlation spikes beyond the initial lag, specifically at intervals that suggest cyclical regime-based dependencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4.3 Architectural Decision: Window Size ($W = 30$)\n",
        "Based on the PACF results showing significant informational spikes at intervals up to lag 35, a window size of **30 cycles** was selected as a balanced trade-off. This provides a mathematically justified \"look-back\" that captures the core degradation memory while remaining small enough to ensure:\n",
        "1. **Responsiveness:** It captures the rapid exponential transitions in the \"wear-out\" phase.\n",
        "2. **Stability:** It provides a reliable statistical baseline for rolling calculations, effectively smoothing the high-frequency jitter observed in the raw normalised telemetry.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4.4 Empirical Findings & Visual Audit\n",
        "Our visual audit of the engineered features (conducted on sensor `s_11_norm` for Unit 1, FD002) confirms the validity of these settings:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Exponential Degradation Trajectory:** The Rolling Mean effectively isolates a distinct exponential curve pattern. We observe a prolonged \"Stable Phase\" followed by an accelerated \"Wear-out Phase\" starting around cycle 100.\n",
        "* **Volatility Observations:** In this specific snapshot of `s_11`, the volatility band (Rolling Std) remains relatively constant in width. The explicit calculation of variance ensures the model can distinguish between high-frequency stochastic noise and low-frequency structural drifts.\n",
        "* **Generalisation Caveat:** It is assumed that the \"widening signature\" (increasing jitter) may manifest in other sensors or across different fault modes in FD004. This investigative exercise serves as a validation of our **Trend Extraction** logic rather than a global definition of all sensor behaviours."

        "This notebook concludes the transformation of raw C-MAPSS telemetry into a research-grade 3D tensor format. By implementing a strict **Split-then-Scale** architecture, we have ensured a biologically and statistically isolated pipeline for model benchmarking.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6.1 Key Technical Milestones\n",
        "* **Target Engineering:** Implemented a Piecewise Linear RUL with a saturation threshold of **125 cycles**. This follows the methodology established by **Heimes (2008)** and modern benchmarks by **Li et al. (2018)** to stabilise model training by ignoring early-life stochastic noise.\n",
        "* **Leakage-Proof Scaling:** Developed a protocol that learns regime centroids and sensor statistics solely from the Training split, projecting these parameters onto the Validation set to ensure zero data leakage.\n",
        "* **Trend Extraction:** Applied a 30-cycle rolling window to extract the **exponential degradation trajectory**. Visualisation of sensor `s_11_norm` confirms that the rolling mean effectively isolates the wear-out signal.\n",
        "* **3D Tensorisation:** Converted long-format data into 3D arrays of shape `(Samples, 30, Features)`. This satisfies the input requirements for Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Attention-based architectures.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6.2 Empirical Observations\n",
        "* **Trajectory:** A distinct exponential \"acceleration\" is visible in the trend features after cycle 100.\n",
        "* **Volatility:** While volatility remained relatively constant for `s_11`, the inclusion of rolling standard deviation provides the model with the capacity to detect instability signatures in other sensors/datasets.\n",
