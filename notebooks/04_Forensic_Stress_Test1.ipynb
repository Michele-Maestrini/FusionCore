        "The primary objective of this notebook is to conduct a **Forensic Stress Test** of the predictive framework to ensure that Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimations are derived from physical sensor signals rather than metadata artefacts. Following the discovery of near-perfect predictive accuracy in the initial baseline, this notebook serves as a **Methodological Gate** to identify, isolate, and remediate **Structural Temporal Leakage**.\n",

        "To ensure the model is fit for safety-critical aerospace deployment, we move beyond standard accuracy metrics and subject the architecture to three validation pillars:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Temporal Blindness Audit:** Systematically removing timestamp and index metadata to determine if the model is \"cheating\" by interpolating a linear countdown rather than interpreting thermodynamic degradation.\n",
        "* **Physics-Aware Feature Engineering:** Augmenting the dataset with kinematic derivatives—**Delta ($\\Delta X$)** and **Rolling Means ($\\bar{X}$)**—to force the model to focus on the *velocity* of degradation (Condition-Based Monitoring) rather than simple asset age.\n",
        "* **Anomaly Sensitivity Stress Test:** Injecting synthetic sensor failures into \"healthy\" early-life assets to verify if the model prioritises physical evidence over the elapsed \"clock\". A model that ignores a catastrophic sensor spike in favour of the asset's age is deemed a safety failure.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.2 Success Criteria & Domain Metrics\n",
        "* **Honest Baseline Establishment:** Transitioning from an artificial $10^{-9}$ MAE to a physically grounded **MAE (~2.28)** that accurately reflects sensor noise and stochastic wear.\n",
        "* **Prognostic Logic Verification:** Success is defined by the model's ability to reduce RUL predictions in direct response to physical sensor spikes, demonstrating a \"Prognostic Reasoning\" capability.\n",
        "* **Data Readiness (v1_physics):** The final output is a sanitised, high-fidelity `.parquet` dataset, stripped of all temporal shortcuts and ready for a rigorous comparison against State-of-the-Art (SOTA) architectures in the subsequent phase."

        "\n",
        "## 1. The Performance Gap: Tabular vs. Deep Learning\n",
        "The **DirectTabular** and **WeightedEnsemble** models are achieving near-zero error (order of $10^{-9}$), while heavyweights like **Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)** and **Chronos** are trailing by orders of magnitude.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **The Critique:** In aerospace predictive maintenance, a \"perfect\" score often signals **data leakage**. If your features include variables that are mathematically derived from the target or if the test set contains \"future\" information leaked through windowing/shuffling, your model isn't learning physics—it's learning an identity function.\n",
        "* **The Gap:** Why is TFT at $-0.13$ while DirectTabular is at $-2.47 \\times 10^{-9}$? TFT is designed to handle complex non-linearities and global patterns. If a simple tabular model beats it this decisively, your underlying signal might be highly linear or the dataset size might be too small for the TFT to converge on the manifold.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Chronos and Pre-trained Models\n",
        "It is notable that **Chronos2 (Large)** outperformed the **FineTuned Small** version.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **The Methodology Flaw:** The `ChronosSmallFineTuned` model has a significantly worse test score ($-1.499$) compared to its validation score ($-0.687$). This is a textbook case of **overfitting**. In a reliability context, this is dangerous; it suggests the model has \"memorised\" the training degradation curves and fails to generalise to the unique sensor noise or initial conditions of the test units.\n",
        "* **Inference Latency:** Note the `pred_time_test`. Chronos2 is roughly **38× slower** than `RecursiveTabular`. For real-time health management in an edge environment (like an orbital satellite or a turbine controller), that latency penalty is a deal-breaker unless the accuracy gain is massive—which here, it isn't.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. The \"Naïve\" Baselines\n",
        "**SeasonalNaive** and **AutoETS** are sitting at scores of approximately $-1.0$.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **The Interpretation:** Since these are baselines, they define the \"floor\" of acceptable performance. Any model scoring worse than $-1.0$ (like your fine-tuned Chronos or the Regressor variant) is effectively performing worse than a model that just guesses the last known seasonal value.\n",

        "* **The Zero-Error Phenomenon:** Can you justify a score of $10^{-9}$? In aerospace, sensor noise usually dictates a higher error floor. Verify that you haven't included the \"Time-to-Failure\" (TTF) as a feature.\n",
        "* **Prognostics Horizon:** Is the model predicting just the next timestamp (one-step-ahead) or the entire RUL curve? One-step prediction is often trivial for maintenance planning."

        "### Investigating the \"Near-Perfect\" Score\n",
        "\n",
        "To identify why `DirectTabular` is achieving $10^{-9}$, we must scrutinise two areas: **Windowing Logic** and **Feature Leakage**.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. The Windowing Logic\n",
        "In time-series for predictive maintenance, a common error is \"shuffling before windowing.\" If you create windows and then perform a random train-test split, the model might see windows that overlap significantly in time.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* **The Test:** Are you using a **Time-Series Split** (Walk-forward validation) where the test set is strictly chronologically after the training set?\n",
        "* **The Risk:** If you used a random split on overlapping windows, the model is **interpolating** between data points it has already seen in a slightly different window.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Feature Importance & Leakage\n",
        "The fact that `DirectTabular` is winning suggests the relationship is highly structural.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **The \"ID\" Problem:** If the engine/unit ID or the \"Cycle Number\" is treated as a raw numerical feature, the model might be mapping the target directly to the cycle count rather than learning degradation physics.\n",
        "* **Lag Leakage:** If your features include $Y_{t-1}$ and you are predicting $Y_t$ in a system with very high sampling frequency, the \"score\" will look perfect because the signal hasn't changed enough to challenge the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. Definitive Answers on Methodology\n",
        "To move from suspicion to rigour, we must perform these three tests:\n",
        "1.  **The \"Null Feature\" Test:** Train using only the Time or Cycle column. The goal here is to establish a baseline of how much information is leaked simply by knowing \"where\" we are in the life of the asset. In many datasets (like C-MAPSS), degradation is almost perfectly correlated with the cycle count.\n",
        "2.  **Permutation Importance:** Identify if a single sensor is a proxy for the target. We need to see which sensors are \"carrying\" the prediction. If one sensor is a mathematical proxy for the Remaining Useful Life (RUL), the model will exploit it.\n",
        "3.  **The Chronological Gap Test:** Introduce a \"gap\" of 10-20 cycles between training and testing. If the score collapses, leakage via temporal proximity is confirmed. This is the \"stress test\" for temporal leakage. We simulate a real-world scenario where we don't have the \"immediate past\" data points during the prediction phase"
